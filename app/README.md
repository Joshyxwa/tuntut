# Tuntut — prototype

A clickable prototype of the Tuntut flow. No build step, no dependencies, no server.

**Run it:** double-click `index.html` (or `open app/index.html`). That's it.

## Realtime voice guide

The practice guide uses an authenticated ElevenLabs agent and falls back to the browser's speech synthesis. Deploy `app/` to Vercel and set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID`. In ElevenLabs, require authentication, allowlist the production domain, add English, Malay, and Simplified Chinese as supported languages, and enable only the **Language** client override under Security. Keep first messages and voices in each language preset; the browser deliberately does not override those fields. Add the three voices listed below to the workspace, then assign each one in that language's voice settings. Create only one client tool: `getCurrentGuideStep` with no parameters and **Wait for response** enabled. Paste [`elevenlabs-agent-prompt.md`](elevenlabs-agent-prompt.md) into the agent system prompt. Its mandatory per-turn tool call continuously refreshes the current browser step without giving the agent permission to act. Restrict the API key to the agent endpoints and set a low workspace credit limit.

| Language | Voice | Voice ID |
|---|---|---|
| Malaysian English | Christine — calm, professional Malaysian/Singaporean English | `Y7xQSS5ZtS4xv4VJotWd` |
| Bahasa Melayu | Athira — warm, encouraging Malaysian Malay | `BeIxObt4dYBRJLYoe1hU` |
| Mandarin Chinese | Chen — warm, conversational Mandarin | `4NQthjVhIGGVfL3Si000` |

The selected language is fixed when the widget is created; reload the guide to start a call in another language. The signed-URL function applies a small per-instance request limit as defense in depth. Keep the ElevenLabs domain allowlist and workspace quota enabled because serverless instances do not share rate-limit memory.

## The flow

```
index.html ──IC──► (2s) ──► story.html ──"Claim RM 3,410"──► [sign-up modal] ──► dashboard.html
                             carousel                                              ▲     │
                                 ▲                                                 │     │
                                 └──────────────────── toggle ────────────────────┘◄───┘
```

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Landing. Takes an IC, fakes a 2s check, hands off to the carousel. Also **resets the session** — every run starts clean. |
| `story.html` | The carousel / "simple view". One scheme per card, one button forward. Ends on the claim CTA, which opens the sign-up modal — a `<dialog>` in this same page, so there is no auth page. |
| `dashboard.html` | The full dashboard, grouped into ready-to-use / we'll-file-it / needs-a-step. |
| `no-results.html` | The "nothing found" empty state. |

## Demo ICs

| Type this | You get |
|---|---|
| **Any 12 digits** | The full flow — carousel → claim → sign-up → dashboard |
| `000000000000` | The **"Nothing found"** empty state |

The landing page shows `XXXXXX-XX-XXXX` as the placeholder rather than an example number, and no real-looking
IC appears anywhere in the app or these docs. A plausible IC is somebody's actual IC, and printing one both
invites people to type a stranger's number and teaches the wrong habit for a product whose whole promise is
that it doesn't hoard your identifiers.

## The data

**`data/tuntut-data.js` is the single source of truth.** Edit it before you run the app; nothing writes to it
at runtime. It's deep-frozen on load, so a stray assignment throws in strict mode instead of quietly
corrupting a demo.

**Why `.js` and not `.json`:** browsers block `fetch()` of a local file from a `file://` page (null origin),
so a real `.json` only works behind a web server and breaks double-click-to-open. It's the same object, the
same single source of truth and the same read-only guarantee — just delivered as a global instead of fetched.
*(We built the `.json` version and it worked fine; it just wasn't worth needing a server to demo.)*

**The RM totals are not in it.** `assets/app.js` adds them up from the schemes, so the headline is the sum of
its parts *by construction* and can't drift out of step with the rows beneath it:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `rm` + `claimKind: "tap"` | already on the MyKad — counts toward **readyToUse** |
| `rm` + `claimKind: "apply"` | needs a form — counts toward **needsApplying** |
| `worth` | **display only, never summed** — a value that isn't spendable cash |
| no `claimKind` | carries no ringgit (not eligible, or locked) — counted nowhere |

`found` = `readyToUse` + `needsApplying`. `schemeCount` = schemes worth more than zero.

**`worth` vs `rm` is the important distinction.** PeKa B40 has `worth: 60` — [ProtectHealth pays the clinic
RM 40 for the first visit + RM 20 for the follow-up](https://protecthealth.com.my/peka-b40/) — so the slide can
answer "what's this worth to me?". But it's a *service*, not money you can spend, so it has no `claimKind` and
never touches the totals. Putting it in a pile labelled "already yours" would be a lie.

**BUDI95 is the one computed scheme.** It stores `litres`, not ringgit, because a fuel quota is only worth
what the subsidy saves you — and that moves weekly:

```
rm = round(litres × (meta.ron95.unsubsidised − meta.ron95.subsidised))
```

`meta.ron95` is dated (`priceWeek`) on purpose. The subsidised price is fixed at RM 1.99; the unsubsidised
price floats under the Automatic Pricing Mechanism (RM 2.60 at BUDI95's launch, RM 3.42 in mid-July 2026).
Update those two numbers and the fuel's value, the "already yours" total and the headline all move together.

**eKasih deliberately has no `claimKind`** even though it shows RM 1,200 — that figure is unrevealed until
the user connects MyDigital ID. Counting money we can't see would be promising what we don't know.

## The status system

Our users are **B40 and elderly**, so every verdict is **glyph + colour + plain word** — never colour alone.
Set `status` (`good` / `warn` / `bad`) and `statusLabel` on a scheme; the carousel and dashboard both follow.
✓ good · ! warn · ✕ bad.

Two rules that are easy to break by accident:

- **Don't make everything positive.** mySalam is "Not eligible" and the empty state exists *on purpose* —
  a tick only means something because something else can be a cross.
- **Colours split in two.** `--pos` / `--gold` / `--bad` are decorative (bars, borders). Anything carrying
  **text** uses `--pos-deep` / `--gold-deep` / `--bad-deep`, which are measured ≥4.5:1. White on plain
  `--gold` is 3.45:1 and fails.

## Layout

```
app/
├── data/tuntut-data.js   ← THE data. Read-only. Change numbers here.
└── assets/
    ├── theme.css         design system: tokens + shared components
    ├── entry.css         landing + no-results   ├── app.js       shared runtime
    ├── story.css         carousel               ├── landing.js   story.js
    └── dashboard.css     dashboard              └── dashboard.js no-results.js
```

Every page loads the same three scripts in order (`defer` preserves it):
`data/tuntut-data.js` → `assets/app.js` → `assets/<page>.js`.

## Notes & known limits

- **The data is Ahmad's regardless of the IC you type.** Any 12 digits pass; it's a prototype.
- **The 2s load is hardcoded** (`LOAD_MS` in `assets/landing.js` and `assets/story.js`).
- **The sign-up modal is mock.** Google and Facebook aren't wired to anything; no account is created and
  nothing is sent. The modal says so.
- **The claim button says `RM 3,410`** — `totals.needsApplying`, not the full total, because that's the only
  part the "5 minutes" actually buys. The already-yours money sits beside it, so nothing is hidden.
- **The carousel card is a fixed 560×600.** That's deliberate: the Next button must never move between
  slides. Below a 600px viewport it relaxes to fit.
- **Fraunces loads from Google Fonts**, so offline it falls back to Georgia — close, slightly less refined.
- Flow state (`tuntut.ic`, `tuntut.authed`) lives in `localStorage`, not `sessionStorage`, which is
  unreliable across some navigations. `index.html` clears it on load, so it still behaves like a session.

## Design

Paper Premium · Prussian Blue. All tokens live in `assets/theme.css` `:root` — every page reads them, so
changing the palette there re-skins the whole app at once. Rejected directions and the other palettes are
archived in [`../info/design-explorations/`](../info/design-explorations/README.md).
